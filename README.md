# Muddy Dark

I spent a decent amount of time customizing a theme called `Theme +` which is ironically easier found when searching `+theme`... After all that fine-tuning I thought I might as well try making my own theme. So this is lightly inspired by the brown version of `Theme +` with a less subtle brown background.

## Color palette

I dislike seeing all colors of the rainbow in the syntax highlighting but still ended up using quite a few myself. The main colors are shades of brown and yellow but there's some green and purple in there as well and I like my operator symbols nice and visible as well. All in all it turned out to be a theme which is very easy on the eyes.

## Feedback

This theme is for the most part a first try but I did tune it a little bit for use with F# (with semantic highlighting on). Maybe that made it better for functional languages in general, who knows. Although this was just quickly put together for personal use, any feedback is welcome.
